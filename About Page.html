    <h1>About Golconda</h1>
        <img src="Golkonda fort.jpg"Alt="Golconda"height="400"width="500">
    
        <li>Golconda Fort is a fortress and the early capital of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty in Hyderabad,
             Telangana. The Golconda consists of four forts spread over an 11-kilometre span with 
            eight entrances. Golconda is famed for its diamond mines, which yielded legendary gems
             like the Koh-i-Noor, Blue Hope, and Daria-e-Noor.

            For 62 years, the first three Qutb Shahi Sultans developed the mud fort
             into the present architecture, a gigantic granite stronghold stretching 
             over 5 kilometres.
            The Golconda was initially called Mankal, and Kakatiyas (South Indian Dynasty)
             established it in 1143. (South Indian Dynasty). It is said that a shepherd kid
              discovered an idol of a deity at the location when Kakatiyas were constructing the fort.
